                <p> Hi, my name is Angel. I am 17, fresh out of highschool starting my first year in college 
                    at Humber Polytechnic, currently enrolled in the Computer Porgramming and analysis
                    Program. I have always found an interest in coding and programming but never really 
                    pursued the study simlpy because I was either too busy with sports, hobbies, and other 
                    interests. </p>

                <p>  
                    Some of my interests that take up most of my life at the moment is Mountain Biking, Baseball, and computers. My family had signed me 
                    up for baseball when younger so I always 
                     
                    had a passion for the sport. Similarly, my family always went out on the weekends to parks to go on bikerides when I was little and 
                    that always stuck with me and has made 
                     
                    mountain biking a hobby I enjoy. I have always been interested in computers since a very young age, introduced with videogames, and am 
                    very familiar with computer components
